        <p class="subtitle">KPI Requirements</p>
        <p>We need to analyze key indicators for our pizza sales data to gain insights into our business performance. Specifically, we want to calculate the following metrics:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Total Revenue:</strong> The sum of the total price of all pizza orders.</li>
            <li><strong>Average Order Value:</strong> The average amount spent per order, calculated by dividing the total revenue by the total number of orders.</li>
            <li><strong>Total Pizzas Sold:</strong> The sum of the quantities of all pizzas sold.</li>
            <li><strong>Total Orders:</strong> The total number of orders placed.</li>
            <li><strong>Average Pizzas Per Order:</strong> The average number of pizzas sold per order, calculated by dividing the total number of pizzas sold by the total number of orders.</li>
        </ol>

        <p> <h3 class="subtitle">Charts Requirements </h3>We would like to visualize various aspects of our pizza sales data to gain insights and understand key trends. We have identified the following requirements for creating charts:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Daily Trend for Total Orders:</strong> Create a bar chart that displays the daily trend of total orders over a specific time period. This chart will help us identify any patterns or fluctuations in order volumes on a daily basis.</li>
            <li><strong>Monthly Trend for Total Orders:</strong> Create a line chart that illustrates the hourly trend of total orders throughout the day. This chart will allow us to identify peak hours or periods of high order activity.</li>
            <li><strong>Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category:</strong> Create a pie chart that shows the distribution of sales across different pizza categories. This chart will provide insights into the popularity of various pizza categories and their contribution to overall sales.</li>
            <li><strong>Percentage of Sales by Pizza Size:</strong> Generate a pie chart that represents the percentage of sales attributed to different pizza sizes. This chart will help us understand customer preferences for pizza sizes and their impact on sales.</li>
            <li><strong>Total Pizzas Sold by Pizza Category:</strong> Create a funnel chart that presents the total number of pizzas sold for each pizza category. This chart will allow us to compare the sales performance of different pizza categories.</li>
            <li><strong>Top 5 Best Sellers by Revenue, Total Quantity, and Total Orders:</strong> Create a bar chart highlighting the top 5 best-selling pizzas based on the Revenue, Total Quantity, Total Orders. This chart will help us identify the most popular pizza options.</li>
            <li><strong>Bottom 5 Best Sellers by Revenue, Total Quantity, and Total Orders:</strong> Create a bar chart showcasing the bottom 5 worst-selling pizzas based on the Revenue, Total Quantity, Total Orders. This chart will enable us to identify underperforming or less popular pizza options.</li>
        </ol>

        <!-- Project Description -->
        <h1 class="subtitle" ><strong>Pizza Sales Data Analysis Project</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my first data analysis project featured in my portfolio. In this project, I embarked on a journey to explore pizza sales data, extract valuable insights, and present them using effective visualizations.</strong></p>

        <!-- Problem Statement -->
        <h3 class="subtitle">Problem Statement</h3>
        <p>As a budding data analyst, I aimed to uncover key performance indicators in the pizza sales industry to provide actionable insights for improving business strategies. I wanted to analyze sales trends, customer preferences, and performance metrics to contribute to data-driven decision-making.</p>

        <!-- Data Sources -->
        <h3 class="subtitle">Data Sources</h3>
        <p>For this project, I utilized a dataset containing pizza sales information, including order details, pizza categories, sizes, and prices. This data served as the foundation for my analysis, enabling me to dive deep into the pizza sales landscape.</p>

        <!-- Key Metrics and Analysis -->
        <h3 class="subtitle">Key Metrics and Analysis</h3>
        <p>Throughout the project, I calculated and analyzed several vital metrics, including total revenue, average order value, total pizzas sold, and average pizzas per order. By examining these metrics, I gained a comprehensive understanding of the business's financial performance and customer behavior.</p>

        <!-- Charts and Visualizations -->
        <h3 class="subtitle">Charts and Visualizations</h3>
        <p>To effectively communicate my findings, I employed a variety of charts and visualizations. I created bar charts showcasing daily and monthly trends in total orders, pie charts illustrating the distribution of sales by pizza category and size, and funnel charts comparing total pizzas sold across different categories. These visualizations provided a clear and concise representation of the data.</p>

        <!-- Insights and Recommendations -->
        <h3 class="subtitle">Insights and Recommendations</h3>
        <p>Upon analyzing the data, I discovered fascinating insights. For instance, I identified peak order hours, popular pizza categories, and customer preferences for specific pizza sizes. Based on these findings, I recommended strategies to enhance revenue generation, optimize sales, and tailor marketing efforts.</p>

        <!-- Technical Skills and Tools -->
        <h3 class="subtitle">Technical Skills and Tools</h3>
        <p>Throughout this project, I leveraged my proficiency in data analysis tools such as Power BI to extract, transform, and visualize the data. I applied data cleaning techniques, performed exploratory analysis, and used visualization tools to create informative charts.</p>

        <!-- Challenges and Learnings -->
        <h3 class="subtitle">Challenges and Learnings</h3>
        <p>Like any project, I encountered various challenges that enriched my learning experience. One of the notable challenges was dealing with missing data and ensuring data accuracy. Addressing these issues required me to implement data imputation techniques and data validation processes, ultimately enhancing my technical skills in data preprocessing.</p>
        <p >Furthermore, I incorporated Python into my analysis toolkit. Utilizing Python allowed me to perform advanced data manipulation, establish data relationships, and gain deeper insights into the pizza sales data. By leveraging Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, I was able to execute intricate analyses and produce more nuanced visualizations.</p>
        <p>Overcoming these challenges reinforced the significance of data integrity and meticulous analysis in driving accurate results. These experiences underscored the importance of continuous learning and adaptation in the dynamic field of data analysis.</p>
